<h1 align="center">üîí Make Me A Password üîí</h1>

```sh

Have you ever been frustrated with not being able to create a password, especially given all the different requirements each website or application needs?  I have solved that problem with this awesome tool, which will easily create a password for you and save you time and headaches.

### üè† Homepage
```sh

```

## üíª Installation

```sh
- We were given an incomplete starter code to review, analyze and adjust to meet certain criteria.
- The application needs to generate a password with a length between 8-128 characters whilst giving the user the choice between lower case, upper case, numbers and special characters.
```
## üé¨ Usage
```sh
- Below is a screenshot and the window prompts the user will see.

üõ†Ô∏è The website launched well; however, I did experience (1) issue. It concerns the special characters prompt, of which resulted in "undefined" at times.
